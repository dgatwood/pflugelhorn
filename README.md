The pflugelhorn project (the 'p' is silent): A project to create a 3D-printable plastic flugelhorn

This project is intended to create a flugelhorn that can be 3D printed on a sufficiently large
3D printer (current minimum is just shy of 350mm).

This project's source code is under a BSD license.  Basically, don't sue me, use it however you want,
and maybe make some music with it.

However, when used as-is, this project must be treated as being distirbuted under the much-more-restrictive
Creative Commons by-nc-sa license.  The reason for this is that in its current form, this project
makes a trivial use of Chris Spencer's gears.scad library for the ribbing around the valve caps.
(While mostly decorative, this does make it easier to turn the caps.)

If you wish to use this under the less restrictive BSD license, you must replace the spur_gear call
from Gears library with some alternative or rip it out.
